## AsmXml BSD license
AsmXml is a very fast XML parser and decoder for x86 platforms (Windows, Linux, BSD and Mac OS X). It achieves high speed by using the following features:

Written in pure assembler.
Optimized memory access.
Parsing, validation and lookup at the same time. Lookup makes attributes and elements accessibles in O(1) time.

AsmXml is a very fast XML parser and decoder for x86 platforms (Windows, Linux, BSD and Mac OS X). It achieves high speed by using the following features:

AsmXml 是X86平台上(Windows, Linux, BSD and Mac OS X)非常快的解码工具。它使用以下的特性来达到非常快的速度。

Written in pure assembler.
使用汇编代码
Optimized memory access.
优化内存访问
Parsing, validation and lookup at the same time. Lookup makes attributes and elements accessibles in O(1) time.
To give an idea of the relative speed of AsmXml, the fastest open source XML parsers process between 10 and 30 MBs of XML per seconds while AsmXml processes around 200 MBs per seconds (on an Athlon XP 1800+).

解析、校验、查找使用相同的时间。查找元素可以在O1时间内完成。

This library is also very small, it will increase the size of your application by only 20K.

This parser is intended for applications that need intensive processing of XML, the aim is to quickly load an XML document into C-like structures. This project will likely appeal you if XML parsing is a bottleneck in your data-flow.

Remember: if you really need speed, do not use XML. But if you can't (existing format, enterprise rules, ...), you may have a look at AsmXml.

This library is not for kids ! you have to know how to use an object file with your programming language. And if you don't understand what O(1) means, you should not consider using this library.
